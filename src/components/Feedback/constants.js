In particular, I really value all the comments and feedback on my design work from you, especially your comments in my Figma files. Please keep doing more of that! You always surface issues I didn't consider, call out things that are confusing to you, and are very up front on what is possible/not possible to build and suggest alternatives.",

All these qualities are remarkably encouraging, especially when you consider how early in her career she is. When things would go wrong, she would course correct and get on the right track before I could even get involved and provide feedback or guidance. The quality of being “adaptable” to situations comes to mind as another key strength of Xenia's.",

When I went to one of the Lens web QAs, Xenia had everything ready to go and provided detailed instructions to each of the testers to test everything. I don't think it's an easy task to have all of that as nailed down as Xenia did, and she did it all with grace and ease.",

She convinced key people that having one intern for the summer is low-risk and took on the task of leading this project, and not only am I so glad that she did (because we have 2!! interns now!) but it really shows how strategically she was thinking through all this to instill positive change within engineering.",
