					The Lens web feature was incredibly complex and the
					requirements continued to change basically through to the
					end. Xenia's organizational skills in keeping track of all
					of the use cases and requirements and test cases were
					nothing short of amazing. When I went to one of the Lens web
					QAs, Xenia had everything ready to go and provided detailed
					instructions to each of the testers to test everything. I
					don't think it's an easy task to have all of that as nailed
					down as Xenia did, and she did it all with grace and ease.

					On average, this feature was used by 60% of active $100+
					creators, weekly. This feature is the main channel used by
					creators to communicate with their patrons. One of the
					hardest features across Patreon to maintain, contained 2
					years worth of tech debt and haphazard code additions.

					Piloted a Waterloo intern (co-op) program, coordinated
					hiring and mentorship of two interns, both of whom accepted
					full-time return offers after graduation.
				</Block>

					Xenia's execution of getting this done should be applauded.
					Her idea of doing a pilot [internship program] shows that
					she understood the risk and hesitance that we've had as an
					engineering org towards interns in the past. She convinced
					key people that having one intern for the summer is low-risk
					and took on the task of leading this project, and not only
					am I so glad that she did (because we have 2!! interns now!)
					but it really shows how strategically she was thinking
					through all this to instill positive change within
					engineering.

							<Block mv={1}>Overall</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								Xenia is professional beyond her years,
								technically and intuitively smart, an efficient
								and effective communicator, and fun to work
								with. I've never been prouder of our product,
								thanks not just to her improvement suggestions
								and fixes, but her capacity to deliver quick,
								intelligent feedback, and set proper
								expectations. We were very lucky to have her,
								and I would love to hire her for real. -

							<Block mv={1}>
								Xenia is the definition of an independent worker
								- she always owns issues no matter how
								challenging or frustrating, and is pretty much a
								guarantee to get it done. She's consistently
								delivered both excellent engineering work and
								thorough and thoughtful documentation /
								communication.
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								She constantly demonstrates an ability to remain
								steadfast in her judgment and ability to deliver
								great work when there’s chaos around her. All
								these qualities are remarkably encouraging,
								especially when you consider how early in her
								career she is. When things would go wrong, she
								would course correct and get on the right track
								before I could even get involved and provide
								feedback or guidance. The quality of being
								“adaptable” to situations comes to mind as
								another key strength of Xenia's.
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								Xenia embodies “seek learning” really well. She
								gets up to speed on new areas quickly, she’s
								constantly inquiring about things, and asks
								hard, poignant questions. These further feed
								back into her ability to have great judgment.
								Xenia is fun and joyful, enjoyable to be around,
								and is able to deliver excellent work with an
								easeful attitude. I have learned a lot from
								watching her operate.
							</Block>
						</Block>
						<Block>
							<Block mv={1}>Documentation</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								Xenia created some of the best QA documentation
								I've seen at Patreon. It was incredibly thorough
								and made testing Lens Web easy even though there
								were 50+ states that we tested across user state
								/ browser / device / user type
								(creator/patron/follower) etc.
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								The artifacts of your actual work, such as
								documentation and presentations, show an immense
								amount of care. You clearly invest energy into
								these aspects of the job, and they reflect
								really well on your ability."

								Product Thinking & User Experience
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								I really love working with you and appreciate
								your practical approach to design and
								development. You really advocate for creators
								and care a lot about design and user experience
								in the product. In particular, I really value
								all the comments and feedback on my design work
								from you, especially your comments in my Figma
								files. Please keep doing more of that! You
								always surface issues I didn't consider, call
								out things that are confusing to you, and are
								very up front on what is possible/not possible
								to build and suggest alternatives. - Designer

							<Block mv={1}>Mentorship</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								Xenia is an extremely detail oriented engineer,
								and a very good teacher. She onboarded me at
								Patreon, and onto the massive [team's] frontend
								codebase. She has taught me really great
								debugging techniques, she writes amazing tests,
								and is generally an excellent technical leader.
								She communicates very clearly, and is always
								approachable and willing to help, even during a
								time crunch.
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								Xenia is amazing, and I feel so lucky to have
								her on my team.
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								- Xenia is a great communicator. She explains
								things in a honest, concise, and easy to
								understand way. I always go to Xenia first when
								I have questions about a project.
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								- She is reliable. If you ask her to do
								something, she will do it. You never need to
								follow up!
							</Block>
						</Block>
						<Block>
							<Block mv={1}>Execution and Productivity</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								- Even when we are in crunch time, Xenia
								produces high quality work. This has been so
								clear over the past two quarters with the work
								we have been doing on Make a Post and Posts on
								Tiers. That section of the codebase was very
								difficult to work with, but Xenia led the way
								and made a plan on how to tackle the problem. I
								attribute the success of both of these projects
								to her!
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								Your code delivery is strong. You are
								conscientious of your time constraints more than
								many of your peers, and you commit to getting
								high quality work delivered within these
								constraints without cutting corners.
							</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								[The] final deliverable was superb. Our usage on
								Lens Web is equal to that of Android and iOS,
								but I haven’t seen a single bug report roll in.
								Kudos! For important, high-stakes projects at
								Patreon, Xenia is one of the first people I
								would look to staffing." - Manager on Lens team

							<Block mv={1}>Communication</Block>
							<Block mv={1}>
								While Lens Web didn't have immediate
								dependencies with most of the other mobile
								engineers on the team, Xenia still excelled at
								informing and communicating her current status
								of the lens web project into digestible and
								understandable chunks. I always felt informed
								about what was currently happening, what she was
								blocked on, and what was coming up next, even
								though the feature itself was extremely
								complicated and I don't know a whole lot about
								web.
